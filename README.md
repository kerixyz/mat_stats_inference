League of Legends Competitive Matches is a dataset from 2015 to 2018; where it has information on competitive matches in all regions. League of Legends is a tower defense game, where two teams of five aim to take over the enemy teams base. This dataset looks specifically at the results of competitive matches where it is broken down by season, year, and teams. It has information on individual players and teams, and timestamps and locations of when objectives are taken off the map. This dataset is really large since it spans from 2015 to 2018, I will most likely deprecate the dataset and maybe only focus on 2018, maybe even only Summer 2018. This data is from kaggle.

Questions:
1. Amongst different games, can you point out a specific time interval that is indicative of the winner of a match?
2. How much do early game (pre 20-minutes) kills and gold determine the winner of the match?
3. How much do results of previous matches (in best of 3s or 5s series) affect the result of future games?
